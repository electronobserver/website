I want this place to be a comfortable experience for everyone, which is why I make the effort to continously integrate accessibility features
onto Electron Observer.<br>

My intended goal is to have this website comply with the
[WCAG Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2)]("https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
at Level AA standards.

## Features 
<ul>     
    <li>Item #1</li>
    <li>Item #2</li>
    <li>Item #3</li>
</ul>

## Testing
<ul>     
    <li>Item #1</li>
    <li>Item #2</li>
    <li>Item #3</li>
</ul>
