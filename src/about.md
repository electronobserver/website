## About 

Hello, my name is Hugo. I'm an Electrical Engineer currently based in the Valley of the Sun. I use this website to post things that I make as well as my incoherent monologues. If you want to know more about me in more detail, [take a look at this post](/posts/first/). Also check out the links below if you want to see more of my stuff or contact me.
