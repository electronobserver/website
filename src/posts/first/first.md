Hi! Hello! Howdy! And Ishnu-alah! Welcome to my blog dear reader! I'm stoked to finally have a website of my own up and running. Here's a complimentary post explaining a little bit about who I am and what I am doing.

## I Suck at Web Development

I will be completely honest and admit that creating this place almost killed me as I haven't touched HTML/CSS since I was a sophomore in high school. In fact, this is actually the second iteration of this website. If you managed to see how the first one I wrote ended up looking like — no you didn't.

If you care about the nerdy details, I built this using [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) which runs on JavaScript but permits you to choose from different templating languages. Personally, I'm pairing it with Nunjucks, Markdown, and vanilla CSS. I found it the easiest static site generator to pick up for a beginner such as myself, compared to the alternatives. 

My obsession with Dieter Rams and European modernism at the time of writing pushed me toward a more minimalistic style choice (maybe it's the same affliction that causes academics to be attracted to pure HTML sites — I'm not quite sure). The [Tiny Brutalist CSS framework by pruger](https://github.com/pruger/tiny-brutalism-css?tab=readme-ov-file) provided a component library that was a perfect fit for my needs. 

To wrap everything up under a pretty bow, I opted to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting and deploying my website. To be honest, there is not much to say about why I chose this tool. My website is pretty basic and it would be okay for most options out there. But like I said before, if you care about nerd stuff, now you know.

## Website Artwork

While this website is mainly barebones, I did try to squeeze in a few pieces of artwork for more flavor. The logo in the leftmost corner was comissioned by one of my favorite artists [SCJREAL](https://www.instagram.com/scjreal/). It represents the logo for my own personal maker pseudonym "PhaseFive Electronics". They did a fantastic job with the design and branding and I'm very happy with how it turned out!

I designed the favicon myself. It’s supposed to be a dispersive prism, which is something I’ve always thought looked pretty cool on its own, not to mention how well it aligns with my areas of study. I plan to add a lot of custom art pieces here in the future in the form of easter eggs, so be on the lookout for that.

## Alright, What's All This Then?

At the time of writing, I am an electrical engineer by trade working in the space industry. However, I didn't actually follow the most direct path into the field. I was originally set on pursuing illustration, but I decided to apply to undergraduate computer science programs at the last minute because they seemed more practical.

In college, I eventually realized I preferred hands-on work and became more interested in hardware and physics, so I switched my major to electrical engineering. Not long after, I landed a six-month internship at an aerospace research division within an FFRDC, where I was exposed to mind-blowing projects. From there, I fell in love with spacecraft technologies and the rest was history.

While there's so much to explore, as of now, my interests primarily lie within these topics:

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <ul>
        <li>RF / Microwave Engineering</li>
        <li>Optical Sciences & Engineering</li>
        <li>Signal Processing</li>
        <li>Embedded Programming</li>
        <li>FPGA Development</li>
    </ul> 
</div>

For better or for worse, I haven't been one to share my thoughts and creations online. Now that I have more time, I want to commit to self-learning, and I’d like to return to graduate school one day, ideally for optics or electromagnetics so I can work on sensors. My dream goal would be to work on payloads for deep space missions however, I am also a huge fan of atomic stuff and can see myself working on nuclear instruments. 

What I want most from this website is a way to monitor my growth over time or in other words, somewhere to post things I find cool online in hopes of becoming an open source-or-er. 

## Thanks for Reading!

I see you've made it to the end without falling asleep. There's probably more that I can say to paint a fuller picture of myself but I'm stopping here because at this point I am failing to form cohesive thoughts. Feel free to take a look around. There's more to come in the future!
